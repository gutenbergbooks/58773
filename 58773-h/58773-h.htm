<h2>BY JOE LOVE</h2>

<p class="ph1"><i>There are human beings who function "like machines" and<br />
there are machines which seem to be "almost human". So&mdash;the<br />
problem in this case was not murder, or who committed it<br />
but who was the "machine" and who was the "human being".</i></p>

<p>On January 5, 1997 Isobel Smith became Isobel Smith d'Larte. On
November 13, 1997 Isobel Smith d'Larte gave birth to a boy-child who
died. And on March 20, 1998 Isobel Smith d'Larte was placed on trial
for the willful and premeditated murder of her husband Arnaud d'Larte.</p>

<p>"Not Isobel," said her friends. "Not Isobel. Too mousey. So quiet.
Surely it wasn't Isobel."</p>

<p>"But it's the quiet type you've got to watch out for," said others.
"Probably has a lover somewhere. She was younger than her husband you
know. Much younger. Too much younger."</p>

<p>"Killed him for his money," said the people on the street. "Read where
she likes art and museums, stuff like that. Must be a queer one that
Isobel d'Larte."</p>

<p>The accusations piled high against Isobel, but she said nothing. She
sat in court, a tiny figure in black saying nothing, seemingly not even
listening to the accusations of the Prosecutor.</p>

<p>"We will prove willful and premeditated murder," the Prosecutor
thundered.</p>

<p>"Easily done," an old woman in the audience murmured spitefully. "Young
wife, old husband. Rich husband. Murder! Easily proved."</p>

<p>"First witness," the Prosecutor called. "Sergeant Melot."</p>

<p>Sergeant Melot took the stand. The witness chair creaked under his
weight. He answered a loud, "I do," when the clerk swore him in.</p>

<p>"Tell us about finding the body," the Prosecutor said. "Miss no
details."</p>

<p>"A Mrs. Watson, servant of Arnaud d'Larte, called us at nine five P.M.
on March 15. Her master was dead, she said. When we answered her call
we found Mr. d'Larte's body in his bedroom. He had been dead for about
an hour."</p>

<p>"The cause?"</p>

<p>"Beaten to death. Beaten with an iron statue of Venus. Evidence of a
struggle. Twenty wounds on his head."</p>

<p>"Twenty wounds, Sergeant Melot?"</p>

<p>"Twenty. The first, or second, would have been enough to kill him. But
there were twenty."</p>

<p>The audience gasped and the Prosecutor smiled. "And where was Mrs.
d'Larte?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Locked in her bedroom. Had to break the door down to get to her."</p>

<p>"Did you speak to her?"</p>

<p>"We spoke to her, but she didn't speak to us."</p>

<p>The audience laughed and the judge rapped for silence.</p>

<p>"The iron statue of Venus, the one found near Mr. d'Larte's body, you
found fingerprints on it, did you not?" Sergeant Melot nodded. "Whose
fingerprints were they, Sergeant Melot?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. d'Larte's."</p>

<p>"Your witness," the Prosecutor told the Defense.</p>

<p>"No questions," said the Defense.</p>

<p>"Why ask questions," a spectator commented. "She's guilty."</p>

<p>"Next witness."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Abby Watson to the stand please."</p>

<p>Abby Watson strode to the witness chair. Her shrew-like eyes flicked
sharply towards Isobel d'Larte then away. Her answer to the clerk who
swore her in was sharp and positive.</p>

<p>"How long have you worked for Mr. d'Larte?" the Prosecutor asked.</p>

<p>"Fifteen years."</p>

<p>"In your opinion Mr. d'Larte was a good employer?"</p>

<p>"The best. A wonderful man, but a lonely one. That woman tricked him
into marriage. Played on his loneliness."</p>

<p>"Objection."</p>

<p>"Objection sustained. Confine yourself to the questions please."</p>

<p>"Mr. d'Larte was older than his wife?" the Prosecutor asked.</p>

<p>"Eighteen years older."</p>

<p>"Was it a happy marriage?"</p>

<p>"At first, at least on his part. He was contented, but she seemed
restless. Always wanted to go to museums and see paintings, or playing
her silly antique records all day. Not content with the government
'Do-It-Yourself' kits. Called them mechanical and expressionless. She
insulted Mr. d'Larte's friends time and again. Called them frauds. Said
their paintings, books and plays were terrible. Said that real talent
was dead.</p>

<p>"You said she spent a lot of time in museums?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say it, but she did. Every chance she got. She'd be gone for
hours."</p>

<p>"Which museum? The one commemorating the wars? The Museum of Mechanics?"</p>

<p>"None of those. She'd go to the old one on the hill. That horrible
thing with the relics of the past in it. The one run by the robots. The
one run by the government to remind us of the past when only a few were
allowed talent and not everybody like today. But I think she went to
the museum for another reason. No one could <i>really</i> be interested in
those things they have there."</p>

<p>"What do you think she went for, Mrs. Watson?"</p>

<p>"To meet her lover. Shortly before he was killed Mr. d'Larte confessed
to me that he was of the same opinion."</p>

<p>"See, I told you she had a lover," someone whispered. "Old husband,
young wife. I just knew there was a lover."</p>

<p>"Objection," said the Defense. "There is no proof that Mrs. d'Larte
went to the museum to meet a lover. There are only opinions, guesses."</p>

<p>"If your honor will permit me to call my next witness I think I can
prove that there was a lover," the Prosecutor said.</p>

<p>The judge leaned forward in eager anticipation. "Call your witness."</p>

<p>"Bella Whychek."</p>

<p>A fat, dumpy, flame-haired woman made her way to the witness stand. As
she was sworn in she tugged self-consciously at her too tight girdle.</p>

<p>"Miss Whychek&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. ... I'm a widow."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Whychek, would you tell us where you are employed."</p>

<p>"Timon's and Sons. I'm a secretary there."</p>

<p>"And where is your office located."</p>

<p>"In the building just across the street from the Museum of the
Past&mdash;the one you were just talking about to that other woman."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Whychek, do you recognize the woman sitting over there?" the
Prosecutor asked as he pointed to Isobel d'Larte.</p>

<p>"Indeed I do. I saw her most everyday."</p>

<p>"Would you tell us the circumstances."</p>

<p>"Well, from the window in my office I have a very good view of the park
that is next to the museum. About a month ago I began noticing that
woman in the park. I couldn't help but notice her, she came so often."</p>

<p>"Alone, Mrs. Whychek?"</p>

<p>"At first yes. She'd go into the museum, stay about two hours or so,
then come out and sit in the park. She never did anything but sit."</p>

<p>"Was she always alone?"</p>

<p>"I was just coming to that. After about a week I noticed that a man
would come and sit with her in the park."</p>

<p>"Could you describe the man?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid I couldn't. He always wore a long overcoat and a hat
pulled down over his face. Both the overcoat and the hat were very old
though. I did notice that. They looked like they might have dated from
around 1950."</p>

<p>"And what did this man and Mrs. d'Larte do in the park?"</p>

<p>"Just sat. Talked I guess. I never saw them kiss or anything if that's
what you mean. Of course many times they would still be sitting there
when I left work. What they did after that I don't know."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. d'Larte definitely did meet a man in the park."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. She met him nearly every day for almost a month."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Your witness."</p>

<p>The Defense rose slowly and walked over to where Mrs. Whychek sat.</p>

<p>"Remember you are under oath, Mrs. Whychek," he said. "You say Mrs.
d'Larte and this man merely sat and talked?"</p>

<p>"As far as I could tell that's all they did. Of course I didn't watch
them every minute."</p>

<p>"Then you can say that they never did anything out of the way, that
their meetings, if they were that, were innocent?"</p>

<p>"As far as I could tell they were."</p>

<p>"Could you say whether the meetings were prearranged?"</p>

<p>"I really couldn't, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will be all, thank you," the Defense interrupted.</p>

<p>So the first day of the trial went. There seemed no doubt that Isobel
d'Larte was guilty. Her friends admitted loudly that poor Isobel had
scandalized them to the core. The papers labeled Isobel queer and
hinted that her lover, whoever he might be, killed Mr. d'Larte for her.
Old fashioned Isobel, they called her. Some had other names for her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the second day of the trial the Defense called its witnesses. There
were only three. Two were character witnesses who hesitantly assured
the court that Isobel d'Larte could not have killed her husband. She
really was a good woman.</p>

<p>The third witness was Isobel herself. When she was called she rose very
slowly and walked to the witness stand. She was sworn in and seated
herself in the witness chair. Her face and hands were chalk white
against the blackness of her dress.</p>

<p>"Mrs. d'Larte, did you kill your husband?" the Defense asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you know who did kill your husband?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why did you lock yourself in your bedroom the night he was killed."</p>

<p>"I wanted to be alone."</p>

<p>The spectators giggled.</p>

<p>"Could you explain how your fingerprints came to be on the iron statue
of Venus? The statue that killed your husband."</p>

<p>"It was my statue. It is quite possible that my fingerprints would be
on it."</p>

<p>"And you heard nothing, no sounds of struggle, the night your husband
was killed?"</p>

<p>"No. I slept awhile that night. I was tired so I locked my door and
slept. I heard nothing."</p>

<p>"Do you know who would want to kill your husband?"</p>

<p>"An enemy I suppose."</p>

<p>"Did your husband have any enemies?"</p>

<p>"Of course, everyone does. Even God has enemies."</p>

<p>That shocked the spectators, but then Isobel had meant it to.
Quite suddenly she found herself hating those in the packed court
room. Hating these upright citizens who had come to delight in her
misfortune. Who sat in smug holier-than-thou attitudes and hoped for
the worst. Not one among them really cared what happened to her&mdash;as
long as it entertained them. Isobel shivered.</p>

<p>"Could you be more specific about your husband's enemies?" the Defense
asked.</p>

<p>"No. He never confided in me. He was only interested in his munitions
factories. In machines. He loved machines. He particularly loved
destructive machines. Some hated him for that."</p>

<p>"The man Mrs. Whychek said you met in the park. Was there such a man?"</p>

<p>Isobel twisted her handkerchief. It was a thin, white snake in her
hands.</p>

<p>"Was there a man, Mrs. d'Larte?" the Defense repeated.</p>

<p>"There was a man."</p>

<p>"Could you tell us his name?"</p>

<p>"I do not know his name. He was a man I met in the park. He was a kind
and gentle man. We talked about art, music&mdash;the beautiful old art and
music. He was well informed about such things. We talked a lot, but I
don't know his name. We just talked."</p>

<p>"Were you in love with this man, or he with you?"</p>

<p>"No! No!"</p>

<p>"You definitely were not lovers?"</p>

<p>"We were not!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mrs. d'Larte. Your witness."</p>

<p>The Prosecutor approached the witness stand. "Mrs. d'Larte, you do not
like the 'Do-It-Yourself' kits the government has put out, do you?"</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"You do not approve or recognize the fact that today everyone is
conceded to have talent, do you?"</p>

<p>"I do not."</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. d'Larte?"</p>

<p>"Anyone can paint, but everyone isn't an artist. Anyone can write, but
everyone isn't an author. Anyone can do anything, but everyone does not
have talent."</p>

<p>"So you spent a great deal of your time in the Museum of the Past
looking at the <i>so-called</i> art treasures there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They were worth looking at."</p>

<p>"And you did not use that to cover up the fact that you met your lover
at the museum?"</p>

<p>"I do not have a lover."</p>

<p>"The man you met in the park, you just talked to him?"</p>

<p>"We talked about the wonderful, the beautiful things in the museum. He
knew about them and loved them as I did. There was no one else I could
talk to about them."</p>

<p>"Naturally," the Prosecutor sneered. "Everyone else knows what frauds
they are."</p>

<p>The spectators laughed.</p>

<p>"Then I like the frauds," Isobel said quietly.</p>

<p>"You claim you were in your bedroom with the door locked and asleep
when Mr. d'Larte was killed. Is that right?"</p>

<p>"That is right."</p>

<p>"And even though your bedroom is right next to Mr. d'Larte's you heard
nothing. Is <i>that</i> right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Your husband struggled, struggled hard before he died, Mrs. d'Larte.
You'll forgive me if I seem skeptical of the fact that you heard
nothing."</p>

<p>"I was asleep. I heard nothing."</p>

<p>"No cry? No crashes?"</p>

<p>"I heard nothing!"</p>

<p>"And the man in the park&mdash;he was not your lover?"</p>

<p>"He was <i>not</i> my lover."</p>

<p>The Prosecutor turned to the judge with a grim smile. "Your honor, I
request a recess so that I may bring in a new witness."</p>

<p>"This witness is not in the court room?"</p>

<p>"No. I myself only learned of him a few minutes ago. It will take about
a half-hour to bring him here."</p>

<p>"And this witness is important?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I believe he can prove that Mrs. d'Larte is lying."</p>

<p>"Then this court is recessed until the prosecution brings in the new
witness."</p>

<p>The spectators buzzed and jibbered excitedly. A new witness. A surprise
witness. The trial was really becoming interesting.</p>

<p>"I hate to leave. I really hate to leave," one said to her companion.
"I'll never get back in if I leave. But one must eat. I hate to leave."</p>

<p>"No need. No need to leave," the companion assured her. "See, I
brought sandwiches. Always bring something to eat to things like this.
People crowd so. It's really terrible. Have an egg?"</p>

<p>"Pretty good trial," an old man with a white beard told the person next
to him. "Not as good as the Bronson trial, but pretty good."</p>

<p>"You've seen a lot of trials?" the figure next to him asked.</p>

<p>"Seen all the good ones," the one with the beard said proudly. "Saw the
Bronson trial in '96, the Treamont trial in '94. Saw a lot of trials.
First time that I've seen one where a wife killed her husband. Most
of the others involved infanticide. Good trials, you understand, but
disappointing. All the verdicts were not guilty."</p>

<p>"Naturally. With over-population infanticide isn't a crime. Rather more
like a good deed these days."</p>

<p>"Understand they are going to legalize the killing of unwanted
children."</p>

<p>"Should have been done long ago."</p>

<p>"People should be more careful. If they don't want children, they
should be more careful."</p>

<p>"If you know you can get rid of them, why be careful?"</p>

<p>A woman fanned herself with her pocketbook and glanced at her
companion. "Have another sandwich, dear?"</p>

<p>"No, on a diet you know." The companion sighed. "It's too bad that they
abolished capital punishment. Believe me, this d'Larte hussy deserves
it."</p>

<p>"But it's so much better the way they do it now, I mean sending the
guilty to the wars to fight in the front lines. Might as well get some
use out of them."</p>

<p>"True. But why bother killing a husband? Divorcing them is so much
easier. Only takes a day and you get half the husband's earnings."</p>

<p>"You should know, dear. You've done it enough."</p>

<p>"Only seven times."</p>

<p>"I thought it was eight?"</p>

<p>"I don't count Rodger. The lout killed himself so he wouldn't have to
pay me a settlement. Ah, here comes the judge."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The spectators stood lazily as the judge entered, then reseated
themselves and buzzed in anticipation.</p>

<p>"Your witness has arrived?" the judge asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Your Honor," the Prosecutor replied.</p>

<p>"Then call him."</p>

<p>The witness was called and sworn in as the spectators gawked at him
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Good looking. Dark. Evil eyes though. Black eyes. I like dark eyes,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Dark blue coat. Lime green sports shirt. Nice combination. Must have a
suit made with those colors."</p>

<p>"Nasty look about that fellow. Wouldn't trust him."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Shhhhhhhhhh!"</p>

<p>Isobel d'Larte stared at the witness in fear.</p>

<p>"Your name, please," the Prosecutor demanded of the witness.</p>

<p>"Andy Kirk."</p>

<p>"You are Mr. d'Larte's nephew?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"What do you do for a living, Mr. Kirk?"</p>

<p>"Anything, but basically I'm an artist."</p>

<p>"Is that what you are doing at the present time, Mr. Kirk?"</p>

<p>"No. Everybody's an artist today. No room for a good one, a real one."</p>

<p>"Then what do you do, Mr. Kirk?" the Prosecutor asked in exasperation.</p>

<p>"Don't shout. I didn't ask to come here."</p>

<p>"What do you do for a living?" the Prosecutor asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Arnaud&mdash;Mr. d'Larte&mdash;paid me to follow his wife. To spy on her. He
paid very well."</p>

<p>The spectators gasped happily. "Now we'll hear something," someone said
in a stage whisper. The judge rapped for silence.</p>

<p>"Why did Mr. d'Larte pay you to follow his wife?"</p>

<p>"He thought she had a lover."</p>

<p>"But you heard Mrs. d'Larte claim that she did not have a lover."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. How could I? I wasn't here."</p>

<p>Laughter rippled through the crowded room and the judge rapped for
silence.</p>

<p>The Prosecutor frowned angrily. "Mrs. d'Larte said under oath that she
did not have a lover."</p>

<p>"She lied."</p>

<p>"Can you prove that she lied?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"And they were really lovers?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. d'Larte told me that she loved him."</p>

<p>"And he loved her I suppose."</p>

<p>"Mrs. d'Larte loved him."</p>

<p>"How long were they lovers?"</p>

<p>"Nearly a month."</p>

<p>"I repeat, can you prove it?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you who her lover is."</p>

<p>"Then by all means do so."</p>

<p>"No! Please, no," Isobel d'Larte cried. "I killed my husband."</p>

<p>When order had been restored in the court the judge stared down at
Isobel.</p>

<p>"Am I to understand that you confess to the murder of Arnaud d'Larte?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Isobel said softly. "I hated him and I killed him. I killed with
the iron statue of Venus. I hit him with it till he died and I hit him
with it after he was dead. I killed him."</p>

<p>Andy Kirk smiled.</p>

<p>It only took a short time to bring in a verdict of guilty against
Isobel d'Larte. She accepted the verdict silently and without
flinching. In like manner she accepted her sentence. She was to be sent
to fight in the front lines of the war in Asia.</p>

<p>"I declare this court adjourned," the judge said and banged his gavel
down authoritatively.</p>

<p>As Isobel d'Larte was taken from the room she was led passed Andy Kirk.
Seeing him, she stopped and stared at him coldly.</p>

<p>"Why did you do this to me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To help you. If the trial had continued the way it had you would have
been judged insane and executed here in the States. In Asia you may
have a chance."</p>

<p>"Does it make a difference if I have a chance? No one really cares."</p>

<p>"You may find what you've been looking for over there."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you, Andy."</p>

<p>"Sometimes one must do bad to do good."</p>

<p>Isobel stared at him not understanding his words, then the guard led
her away. Isobel d'Larte spent the night in jail, and the next morning,
along with twenty other prisoners, was taken to the rocket-port to be
sent to Asia. At the rocket-port the prisoners were allowed to say
their goodbyes to their families without the benefit of guards. Isobel
stood alone watching the tearful farewells, then walked slowly into the
cafeteria. As she sat alone at the corner table drinking coffee a tall
man dressed in an old fashioned top coat and with an old fashioned hat
pulled down over his face walked up to the table and sat down opposite
her. Isobel looked at the figure happily.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come."</p>

<p>"Why did you confess?"</p>

<p>"I did not want them to know about us. They would have made it all so
ugly sounding. They would have made it sound vile ... and it wasn't."
Isobel reached out a hand towards the figure and a metal hand closed
over hers. "I didn't want them to harm you."</p>

<p>"You did it for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I love you."</p>

<p>"I'm a robot. A machine. An unfeeling thing of iron and steel. How can
you love me?"</p>

<p>"My husband was the machine. He ate at the same time everyday, dressed
at the same time, went to work at the same time. He did the same
things, thought the same things everyday of his life."</p>

<p>"But he had emotion."</p>

<p>"Only those he had been taught to feel and those only at the proper
times. He was mad when he should be mad and happy when he should be
happy, nothing more. He was much more of a machine than you."</p>

<p>"But I cannot return your love. I do not know what emotion is."</p>

<p>"I had to have someone," Isobel cried. "I had to have someone who was
kind to me. You liked what I liked. You could talk to me of something
besides machines. Machines do everything now. But you could talk to me
of art, music, beauty."</p>

<p>"My creator taught me those things. Taught me to care for those things
in the museum. I would miss them if they were taken away."</p>

<p>"Yes." Sudden tears stung Isobel's eyes. No one would miss her. No one
would care about her.</p>

<p>"I will miss you too, Isobel. I will miss you very much."</p>

<p>"As much as the things in the museum?"</p>

<p>"As much as those. More."</p>

<p>Isobel stood up, leaned over and kissed the metal cheek of the one
opposite her. "Then it was worth it."</p>

<p>"All prisoners assemble on the runway," a harsh voice boomed over the
loudspeaker.</p>

<p>"Perhaps someday I can learn to return love," the robot said.</p>

<p>"You have done more than that. You have made me happy."</p>

<p>"Come back safely, Isobel."</p>

<p>Isobel d'Larte ran to the runway and joined the other prisoners. They
looked at her strangely not understanding her smile. Isobel barely
noticed them, for she was happy. Someone cared for her. That was the
important thing. <i>Someone cared.</i></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
